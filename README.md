Kaggle competition for Animal Shelter prediction
<br>This competition required quite a bit of data scrubbing. The data was split into "dog" and "cat" subsets (each subset was trained separately). For the dog data, external data (see <i> dog breed file.csv</i>) was used to categorize the dog into more general breed types (Herding, Hound, Mix, Pitbull, Non-sporting, Sporting, Terrier, Toy, Working, and unknown) and also into different size group ( 0-3, toy-large size). For cat data, it showed that the top 5 cat breeds make up 96% of population! So the other cat breeds were grouped into one category ("other"). After some visualization, there was some interesting findings - adoption was considerably higher for animals with Names, and for mix breed. For cats, adoption was more likely for domestic shorthair mix, followed by domestic medium hair mix, then domestic long hair mix. People seem to prefer shorthair cats, maybe they are easier to care for? Finally, XGBClassifier was used to train the model and predict outcome.</br>
