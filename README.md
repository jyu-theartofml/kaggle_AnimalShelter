Kaggle competition for Animal Shelter prediction
This is the Python code for Kaggle competition animal shelter, including original data sets. There was quite a bit of data scrubbing. The data was grouped into "dog" and "cat" subset (each group was trained separately). For the dog data, I used external data(see <i> dog breed file.csv</i>) to categorize the dog into general breed type (Herding, Hound, Mix, Pitbull, Non-sporting, Sporting, Terrier, Toy, Working, and unknown) and also into different size group ( 0-3, toy-large size). For cat data, it showed that the top 5 cat breeds make up 96% of population! So I group the other cat breeds into one category ("other). After some visualization, there was some intersing finding - adoption was considerably higher for animals with Names, and for mix breed. For cats, adoption was more likely for domestic shorthair mix, followed by domestic medium hair mix, then domestic long hair mix. People seem to prefer shorthair cats, maybe they are easier to care for? Finally, XGBClassifier was used to train the model and predict outcome.
